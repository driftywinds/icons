### selfh.st/icons

[selfh.st/icons](https://selfh.st/icons) is a collection of logos and icons for self-hosted (and non-self-hosted) software.

The collection is available for browsing via the directory at [selfh.st/icons](https://selfh.st/icons) and served to users directly from this repo using the jsDelivr content delivery network.

To self-host the collection, users should refer to the [repository's wiki](https://github.com/selfhst/icons/wiki).

### Custom Colors

By default, the directory provides SVG icons (when available) in standard, dark, and light colors. Users looking to display the icons using colors of their choice can become a [paid member of selfh.st](https://selfh.st/perks) or [deploy the collection themselves](https://github.com/selfhst/icons/wiki).

### Requests

Requests for new or updated icons can be made via the repository's [discussions](https://github.com/selfhst/icons/discussions). To ensure quality and consistency, pull requests will not be accepted from unapproved members.
